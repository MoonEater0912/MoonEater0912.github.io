    To develop the mapping algorithms from Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQoL-36) scores onto the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 utility values among the dialysis patients in China. We used data from a cross-sectional multicenter survey study in China to map KDQoL-36 onto EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2. The conceptual overlap between the KDQoL-36 and the EQ-5D-5L or SF-6Dv2 was evaluated by Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficients. Direct mapping, including OLS, GLM, Beta Regression Model (BRM), Tobit Regression Model (TRM), Censored Least Absolute Deviations model (CLAD) and Adjusted Limited Dependent Variable Mixture Model (ALDVMM), and response mapping, Seemingly UnRelated Ordered Probit Model (SUROPM), were used to derive mapping functions using the dataset. The model performance was assessed by mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) using cross-validation. A total of 378 patients (50.53% female; mean [SD] age: 49.05 [13.34]) were included in this study. The mean utility values of EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 were 0.72 and 0.57, respectively. When mapping to EQ-5D-5L, the ALDVMM with 1 component was the best-performing model (MAE = 0.1579, RMSE = 0.2289). When mapping to SF-6Dv2, the TRM was the best-performing model (MAE = 0.1108, RMSE = 0.1508). Generally, KDQoL-36 subscale scores with their square was the optimal predictor set among each model. Overall, models using KDQoL-36 subscale scores showed better fit than using the Kidney Disease Component Summary. ALDVMM and TRM models with the KDQoL-36 scores can be used to predict the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 utility values, respectively, among dialysis patients in China.

    Generic preference-based instruments, such as the Short Form 6-Dimensions (SF-6D) and EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), can generate utility scores that facilitate the estimation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) which is commonly used in cost-utility analysis. This study investigated the associations between utility scores and potential socio-demographic factors in Chinese patients with dialysis using quantile regression. Patients were recruited in a multicenter survey conducted between November 2023 and January 2024 for dialysis patients in China. Patient responses to the SF-6D version 2 (SF-6D v2) instruments were used to calculate utility scores. The relationships between utility scores and potential socio-demographic factors were examined using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and quantile regression models. The Wald test was employed to test the differences in coefficients across quantiles in quantile regression. Model performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. A total of 378 patients were included. Age, education level, having a loan due to illness, currently working, monthly income > 8000 and number of comorbidities were associated with utility scores. The quantile regression coefficients and Wald test suggested that the size of the associations between the utility scores and factors varied along with the utility score distribution. Quantile regression yielded more accurate fitted and predicted values compared to OLS regression. Quantile regression offers a valuable complement in analyzing factors associated with utility scores among Chinese dialysis patients. For policymakers, differentiated nonclinical strategies may be needed to improve HRQoL across varying health states within this population.

  <p><strong>3. Indoor Mold Odor Exposure and Cognitive Function in Older Adults: A Longitudinal Analysis Based on CLHLS Dataset in China</strong>: Under preparation.</p>

    Environmental factors such as air pollution have been linked to cognitive function decline through neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Indoor mold odor, a common air quality issue, may exacerbate cognitive deterioration in older adults via similar physiological mechanisms. This study systematically examined the association between indoor mold odor exposure and cognitive function among older adults in China. Data were obtained from three waves of the nationally representative survey of China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey between 2011/12 - 2018. Modified Mini-Mental Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognition function. Random-effect Panel Tobit model was used to estimate the effect of indoor mold odor on cognition function. The causal effect robustness was tested using housing water leakage/damage as an instrumental variable, together with other robustness checks. Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the heterogeneity of the effect. Indoor mold odor exposure leads to the decline of cognitive function (Coef. = -0.508). This association remains robust when the outcome variable is recoded and when the sample is restricted. Instrumental variable regression further confirmed the robustness of the causal effect, and implicated the role of housing water leakage. Subgroup analyses revealed a stronger negative association in females, individuals with lower education, and rural residents. Indoor mold odor was associated with cognition impairment among elderly populations in China, highlighting the importance of public health policies targeting indoor air quality. The observed heterogeneity by gender, education, and residence suggests that individual susceptibility and social determinants influence the mold-cognition pathway through multiple mechanisms.
