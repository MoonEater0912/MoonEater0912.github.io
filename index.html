  <h1 style="margin-top:0;">About Me</h1>
  <p>Welcome, and thanks for reading.</p>
  <p>I am Chen Zeyuan, currently a master student at Uppsala University, majoring in Social Sciences. In the summer 2025, I worked as a research assistant at Aalto University, Dept. of Computer Science, on a project about academic collaboration network and labour inequality (a manuscript being prepared). I've also been collaborating with a health econometrics group at Renmin University of China for 2 years (several papers accepted). My interests lie in leveraging computational and quantitative methods to measure and understand the dynamics of culture, knowledge and social change. I am looking for a PhD position in this field. My newest CV and contact info can be found <a href="\files\CV_Zeyuan_Chen.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Specifically, my research interests include - </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Computational social science / cultural analyses</li>
      <li>Causal inference with network analysis and NLP</li>
      <li>French philosophy and intellectuals in 20th century</li>
      <li>Philosophy of statistics and computation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before pursuing social science studies, I earned my undergraduate degree in philosophy and sociology, where I focused on probability, contingency, and cybernetics, and wrote my thesis on these topics. I am now working on my master thesis, which aims to conduct a distant reading on the french philosophy journal articles during 1950s to 1980s, following Bourdieu's discussion in Academicus. I have also done a “toy” research project on a digital knowledge-base about philosophy, combining NLP techniques and network analyses, which was accepted by IC2S2 (Norrköping) and ICSSI (Copenhagen).</p>
  <p>I love reading, city walking, programming and playing video games.</p>
