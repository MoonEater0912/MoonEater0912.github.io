This is the ongoing project related with my master thesis. I am still working on the data collecting and preliminary exploration, co-supervised by [Jacob Habinek](https://liu.se/en/employee/jacha66) and [Johan Lindell](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N19-2617).

That said, I have collected the biographical \& publication practices data for 300 French philosophers, and conducted a preliminary Bourdieusian MCA analysis to map the space of positions and habitus. The results could be seen in this [working draft](./files/french_philosophy_MCA_working_draft.pdf).

Text data was requested from [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org). I defined "core philosophy academic journals" and selected 8 journals: 
- Archives de Philosophie
- Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale
- Revue de Théologie et de Philosophie
- Revue des Sciences Philosophiques et Théologiques
- Revue Internationale de Philosophie

I kept the authors having at least 3 publication recordings during 1950 - 1989 as samples (which, although includes most of the well-known philosophers, like Derrida, Deleuze, Canghuileim, etc., excludes more non-traditional philosophers like Foucault - but this is acceptable, as the field of interest is more of an academic one, instead of broader intellectual life). After cleaning and normalizing authors' names (really a HUGE task), I collected author metadata (gender, nationality, birth/death year/place, employer/institution) from [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and [BNF](https://data.bnf.fr) (which is usually linked with IdRef and ISNI), using Python. There are about one fourth of my samples of whom the metadata is unaccessible from WikiData or BNF. For these cases, I tried to have their gender, birth date/place and institution from other sources, like obituaries, footnotes in their publications, interview recording, online philosophy encyclopedias, etc. 

I plan to make it open-sourced once I have supplemented more career-related variables (e.g., whether they is a member of X, whether they has beed invited to seminars of Y) and have collected all the data I could manually.

I am now also trying different ways of representing texts numerically:
- Regarding document-level embedding and topic modelling, I found S-Transformer models (general multilingual models) perform similarly with merely pooling the word embeddings generated by FastText. I am now looking at french-specific transformers to see if they will perform better.
- Regarding identifying conceptural revalance and networks, I am exploring counting-based methods and word-embedding-based methods, which should have better interpretability for philosophical texts, and should be more capable of capturing the semantical shift of concepts.
