<h3> About Me </h3>

Welcome, and thanks for reading.

I am Chen Zeyuan, currently a student at Uppsala University, majoring in social science. I am interested in computation
and
data science, as well as the critique theories of software and network. Specifically, I am currently interested in
users' collective actions and affectedness in
digital media (how they are affected, transformed and reshaped by different types of digital media). Besides, I am also
drawn to social movements, resistence, computational
methods in social sciences, etc.
I post related blogs and projects
here.
Sometimes I will
share my translations (from english/french to chinese) of articles on
french philosophy, and sometimes I will share my recipes.
