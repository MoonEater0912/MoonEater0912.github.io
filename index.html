<h3> About Me </h3>

Welcome, and thanks for reading.

I am Chen Zeyuan, currently a graduate student at Uppsala University, majoring in Social Science.
I am interested in quantitative and computational methods. I am now learning causal inference, text analysis and network
analysis.

I am focused on the research and theories about knowledge production and social movements, and trying combining qual and
quant methods to gain insights.

I love cooking, reading and language learning.

I post related blogs and projects here. Sometimes I will share my recipes.
