    To develop the mapping algorithms from Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQoL-36) scores onto the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 utility values among the dialysis patients in China. We used data from a cross-sectional multicenter survey study in China to map KDQoL-36 onto EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2. The conceptual overlap between the KDQoL-36 and the EQ-5D-5L or SF-6Dv2 was evaluated by Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficients. Direct mapping, including OLS, GLM, Beta Regression Model (BRM), Tobit Regression Model (TRM), Censored Least Absolute Deviations model (CLAD) and Adjusted Limited Dependent Variable Mixture Model (ALDVMM), and response mapping, Seemingly UnRelated Ordered Probit Model (SUROPM), were used to derive mapping functions using the dataset. The model performance was assessed by mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) using cross-validation. A total of 378 patients (50.53% female; mean [SD] age: 49.05 [13.34]) were included in this study. The mean utility values of EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 were 0.72 and 0.57, respectively. When mapping to EQ-5D-5L, the ALDVMM with 1 component was the best-performing model (MAE = 0.1579, RMSE = 0.2289). When mapping to SF-6Dv2, the TRM was the best-performing model (MAE = 0.1108, RMSE = 0.1508). Generally, KDQoL-36 subscale scores with their square was the optimal predictor set among each model. Overall, models using KDQoL-36 subscale scores showed better fit than using the Kidney Disease Component Summary. ALDVMM and TRM models with the KDQoL-36 scores can be used to predict the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 utility values, respectively, among dialysis patients in China.

    Generic preference-based instruments, such as the Short Form 6-Dimensions (SF-6D) and EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), can generate utility scores that facilitate the estimation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) which is commonly used in cost-utility analysis. This study investigated the associations between utility scores and potential socio-demographic factors in Chinese patients with dialysis using quantile regression. Patients were recruited in a multicenter survey conducted between November 2023 and January 2024 for dialysis patients in China. Patient responses to the SF-6D version 2 (SF-6D v2) instruments were used to calculate utility scores. The relationships between utility scores and potential socio-demographic factors were examined using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and quantile regression models. The Wald test was employed to test the differences in coefficients across quantiles in quantile regression. Model performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. A total of 378 patients were included. Age, education level, having a loan due to illness, currently working, monthly income > 8000 and number of comorbidities were associated with utility scores. The quantile regression coefficients and Wald test suggested that the size of the associations between the utility scores and factors varied along with the utility score distribution. Quantile regression yielded more accurate fitted and predicted values compared to OLS regression. Quantile regression offers a valuable complement in analyzing factors associated with utility scores among Chinese dialysis patients. For policymakers, differentiated nonclinical strategies may be needed to improve HRQoL across varying health states within this population.
