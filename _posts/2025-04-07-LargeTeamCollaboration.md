This is the research I worked on as a research assistant at Aalto University, supervised by Keller Barbara. The paper is accpeted to CHI 2026 in Barcelona. I will be presenting there this April!

The full paper can be seen [here](/files/chi26-930.pdf). I conceptualized the initial idea and conducted all the empirical experiments (data cleaning, network exploration, causal identification and robustness tests). I wrote almost all of the sections in the manuscript, except for the final two subsections of the 'Related Work' section, which were co-authored with another graduate student.

We are developing another relevant network-based computational research, trying to mathematically model the team assemblage process and the network evolution, exploring how team sizes together with edge-formation mechanisms could contribute to gender inequality. The premiliry results can be seen [here](https://mooneater0912.github.io/post/2026/01/26/TeamSizeHomophily).

I developed a Python Package implementing the core causal identification technique used in this study (Synthetic DID), which can be seen [here](https://github.com/MoonEater0912/SyntheticDID?tab=readme-ov-file).
