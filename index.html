  <h1 style="margin-top:0;">About Me</h1>
  <p>I am Zeyuan Chen (陈 泽远). I'm from a small coastal county in southeastern mainland China. I enjoy eating iced rice, Chaoshan beef hotpot, and luosifen. After one year of studying mathematics, I completed a double bachelor's degree in Philosophy (Thesis: <em>Contingency and Will</em> ) and Sociology (Thesis: <em>Tech-nography of the Beijing Subway</em> ) at Beijing Normal University. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Social Sciences at Uppsala University (graduating in 2026). </p>
  
  <p>I am interested in computational approaches to socio-cultural analysis. I am not satisfied with merely inferring causal relationships or applying complex and opaque models to large datasets just to see what comes out. I aim to develop and use interpretable NLP and network analysis methods to build substantive mappings between textual semantics and social space. I am currently seeking PhD positions in related fields for Fall 2026. My CV and contact info can be found <a href="\files\CV_Zeyuan_Chen.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Specifically, my research interests include - </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Computational social science / cultural analytics</li>
      <li>Causal inference with network analysis and NLP</li>
      <li>History of culture and intellectuals, particularly in 20th century</li>
      <li>Philosophy of statistics and computation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Storytelling has become a mechanism for accumulating academic capital—it appears not only in manuscripts, but also in personal statements, providing applicants with a coherent, self-motivated narrative. Nevertheless, I have no intention of concealing the heterogeneity, multiplicity, and externally shaped nature of my experiences and interests - </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Since my undergraduate years, I collaborated with a health economics research group at Renmin University of China, primarily to gain my first research experience and a letter of recommendation. In hindsight, this also proved to be a solid methodological training.</li>
      <li>In the summer of 2025, I was accepted to be a research assistant the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University. This provided intensive training in handling large-scale datasets, scientific computing, and network analysis. But I also attempted to introduce my knowledge from the social sciences into scientometrics—a field traditionally leaning more towards computational side.</li>
      <li>My interest in text analysis stems from my humanities background. I have completed two interest-driven toy projects and presented them at IC2S2 and ICSSI. I believe these projects have potential for further development, and I am currently working independently to build digital humanities tools based on them.</li>
      <li>My ongoing master’s thesis is a distant reading project on French philosophy journals of the 20th century. It involves quantitatively mapping the dynamics of concepts and conceptual networks, and linking them to author metadata and external events (such as the May '68 movement).</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Beyond research, I love reading, city walking, learning languages and following american series.</p>
