This is the research I am currently working on as a visiting student at Aalto University, with by Keller Barbara and Anh Duong Nguyen. The idea is motivated by our [previous work](2025-04-07-LargeTeamCollaboration.md) published on CHI.

Currently we have found (details in this [working file](/files/teamsize_workingfile.pdf)) that gender homophily under existing imbalances leads to a persistent over-representation of men in research teams, a disparity that scales positively with team size. In the next steps, we will extend this framework by incorporating network-based recruitment and edge mechanisms to analyze how social topology further drives or mitigates this structural exclusion. Also, what strategies women researchers could take to mitigate their disadvantageous position.
