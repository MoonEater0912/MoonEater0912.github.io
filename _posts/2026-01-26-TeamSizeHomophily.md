This is the research I am currently working on as a visiting student at Aalto University, with Keller Barbara and Anh Duong Nguyen. The idea is motivated by our [previous work](https://mooneater0912.github.io/post/2025/04/07/LargeTeamCollaboration) published on CHI.

The aim is to introduce team-level dynamics, which is largely ignored before, into the analysis of scientific collaboration network. Our current findings are details in this [working file](/files/teamsize_workingfile.pdf)). In short, a large team size could contribute (monotonically increasing) to gender disparity in terms of representation and centrality, even if there is only an unequal gender ratio and identical choice homophily.

In the next step, we plan to apply the model on real-world collaboration network, incorporating Bayesian models to estimate the parameters.
