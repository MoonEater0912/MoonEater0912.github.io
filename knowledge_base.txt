\textbf{Working Title}: Mapping the Intellectual Field: A Computational Study of French Philosophy (1950–1990)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a data collection and cleaning pipeline using Python scraping and LLMs to construct a dataset of authors' metadata, as well as a corpus of French philosophical scholarly writings from 1960 to 1989.
    \item The next step will analyze how scholars from different social origins and institutional backgrounds exhibit distinct publication preferences, as well as the systematic differences in their philosophical writing.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Received a R\& R decision from CHI, and currently addressing reviewer feedback.
    \item Built collaboration networks from the SciSciNet dataset, measured the accumulation of capital and the career development of scholars using a modified version of neighborhood centrality.
    \item Identified the causal effect of large-team collaboration on early-career academic development using Synthetic Difference-in-Differences, and explored whether and how such mechanism reproduces gender inequality in the academia.
