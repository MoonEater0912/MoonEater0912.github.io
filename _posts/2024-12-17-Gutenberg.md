This project uses word embedding vector to reveal the differences between the sci-fi novels before 1930s and after 1950s. Specifically, I analyzed the top 15 most similar vectors with the vector of the word "scientific". The more similar two vectors are, the more close their meanings are.

The data source is [Gutengerg database](https://www.gutenberg.org/). It provides a python API but I cannot make it work on my device. So I wrote a crawling script to acquire the data I need. Basically I need two variables: the summary of the book (which is auto-generated by Gutenberg) and the year the book was published. For filtering those books written in English, I also crawled the language variable. Of course you can extend my script so that it can crawl any other variables you want. 

You can find my script and results [here](/htmls/Gutenberg.html). 

The key findings are:
- Before 1930s, the top 15 scientific-related words are: 'longing', 'social', 'identity', 'romance', 'roles', 'discovery', 'deeper', 'disillusionment', 'foreshadows', 'consequences', 'evolution', 'bravery', 'struggle', 'loyalty', 'technological'
- After 1950s, the top 15 scientific-related words are: 'morality', 'authority', 'technological', 'dangers', 'fear', 'unintended', 'versus', 'impact', 'power', 'advancement', 'boundaries', 'highlighting', 'ambition', 'personal', 'inquiry'
