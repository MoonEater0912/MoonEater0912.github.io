This is my ongoing project translating Anne Conway's posthumous work, *The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy*, from English to Chinese. Anne Conway's work had a great influence on the writing of my undergraduate thesis, in which I tried to show the potential of reinventing her theological thoughts through contemporary ontology. 

The book I am using is published by Cambridge University Press, first published in 1996 and then reprinted in 1999. There is an introduction written by the editors for this version, as well as a previously unpublished introduction written by Henry More, who was Anne Conway's philosophy instructor in her early life. I will first translate all of Anne Conway's work, then Henry More's introduction, and finally the editors' introduction.

Here's what I have done so far:

[Chap 1 to Chap 3](https://mooneater0912.github.io/files/Anne_Conway_Principles/Chap1_3.pdf), concerning Trinity, God and his divine attributes.
