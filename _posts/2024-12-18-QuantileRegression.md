(ongoing)

I drafted a manuscript in my current research assistant position in the field of medical economics. In this research, I used quantile regression to identify the heterogeneity of the effects of some socio-economic factors on patients' quality of life. In this blog I wouold like to share it realization in R, as well as its statistical principles.
