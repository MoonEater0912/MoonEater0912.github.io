This is the research I worked on as a research assistant at Aalto University, supervised by Keller Barbara. The paper is accpeted to CHI 2026 in Barcelona. I will be presenting there this April!

The full paper can be seen [here](/files/chi26-930.pdf).

We are developing another relevant network-based computational research, which can be seen [here](https://mooneater0912.github.io/post/2026/01/26/TeamSizeHomophily).
